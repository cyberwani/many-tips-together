# Many Tips Together
Please visit http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/many-tips-together/ for the official version.

This one is for testing purposes only.

Version: 2.0 beta RC1

Github updater control

~Current Version:2.0.1~

## Description
With MTT you'll be able to simplify and make deep customizations in the administrative interface.

It is a compilation of tips for enhancing, styling and reducing WordPress backend. 
Some are borrowed from other plugins, many are not. 
Usually we put them in the theme's functions.php, 
but if you handle many WordPress installations or swap themes frequently so better plugged then themed.

The plugin interface is pretty straight forward: choose the section and select your customizations.
The tips came from a variety of sources and are documented, whenever due and the best I could, 
throughout the code and in the help sections.
